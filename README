== Overview ==

Page Schemas is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for defining all the
schema information about a "class", or data type - for naming, display,
data input, and browsing - within a single piece of XML contained within a
category page. This XML can then be used to generate all the necessary
additional pages needed to put the schema into effect, such as template
pages and, if Page Forms is installed, form pages. The XML can be created
and edited via a helper form, preventing users from having to generate or
modify it manually.

Page Schemas allows other extensions to define their own fields to add to
the XML, using hooks.

For more information, see the extension homepage at:

== Requirements ==

This version of the Page Schemas extension requires MediaWiki 1.28 or higher.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place the entire 'PageSchemas' directory

== Credits ==

Page Schemas was initially created by Ankit Garg as part of the 2011
Google Summer of Code program. It was then modified substantially by
Yaron Koren, who also mentored the Google Summer of Code project.

Google Summer of Code, again mentored by Yaron.
